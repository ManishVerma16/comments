2. understand that as a user prespective in os user can access only file and folder nothing else and in linux for working we need to login as a root user to access enitre power of an OS and we have two ways of interction GUI and CLI .
3. understand that working with CLI requires only command or programs and for working with files and folder so learnt many command like: mkdir, cd, ls, touch, ls -l, cat, cat >, cat >>, clear, pwd, cd .. , cd -, cd ., cd /, rm -i, rm -rvf, rmdir, cp, rpm -qf, yum remove, yum install and many more.
4. learnt about alias which are nicknames given to command and unalias to remove the nicknames and command.
5. learnt about absolute directory (/) and absolute path(/../.../) to reach to a particular location in the storage.
6. understand that we can create file from touch command and also create and edit them from cat command and redirection. we can create normal file as well as hidden files(.file.txt).
7. understand that GUI and CLI are two different interfaces but the files and folders created by these interface are stored in the same storage devices.
8. understand the recursive concept and implement recursive in removing (rm -rvf command) and copying (cp -r command) files and folders.
9. understand about the yum configure, ifconfig, start or stop firewalls and servers using systemctl commands.

3. steps to create partition 1 create physical and logical partition 2. format 3. mount the partition.
4. there is no way ro remove the file or data permanently if data stored in ElectroMechanical drives.
5. we need some shredding tool to remove data and recovery tool to recover the data.
6. architecture of sata hard-drive and how its different parts working during read and write opertaion.
7. about indexing, index table or inode table for partition which is called file system or format. when we format partition is create internally the Inode table.
8. OS always look the Inode table to calculate the used and free space of any partition.
9. Windows create FAT and NTFS format type, Linux create ext3, ext4 format type. In NTFS creation time is recorded but ext4 store the modification time.
10. In FAT system generally allowed size is 4GB so it doesnot allow to store file greater than 4GB.
11. learnt these commands:  fdisk -l,  mkfs.ext4,  mount, df -h, umount.

2. to store data we need some kind of storage might be HardDisk or pendrive and inside them we create partition as per requirement.
3. steps to create storage : 1. create partition  2. format partition 3. mount partition for use.
4. the mount is temporary and will unlink if we reboot the system. We can use fstab file to make the mount permanent.
5. some usecases where we need to combine two physical drives and use as one or extend the size of drive in case of low storage. ex combinig 2 pendirves of 4GB and 8GB to store 10GB data and extend the storage space of server. 
6. if we want to combine multiple devices and use them as a single device this is done by concept of LVM.
7. what are PV or Physical Volume,VG or volume groups and Logical Volume Management or LVM and how to create VG and the LVM for given two different storage devices.
8. some commands like: fdisk -l, df -h, pvcreate, pvdisplay, vgdisplay, vgcreate, vgextend, lvdisplay, lvcreate, lvextend, resize2fs, mkfs.ext4, mount.
9. df -h shows only that partition which is formated and fdisk -l show all entire drives.
10. mkfs remove the existing data if we run this command after extending the size of partition.

07/06/2020 session 36:
The session was good and I learned so many new things like:
1. to find the login time, login error, worng password attempt, ip of logging device we need to check logs.
2. information or data of any activity is called log and the file is called logfile.
3. everytime linux admin must keep watch on log of event happens in the server.
4. logs help in i) monitoring system in realtime ii) Analysis the traffic coming on the system.
5. Manual editing in logs of a server or a system is a security compliance and a cyber crime.
6. make a complete setup of webserver and client then we make some wrong attempts and then checked the logs and find some useful information regarding about it.
7. understand that without log we cannot analysis the service. In log files we find space as a delimiters.
8. Metrics is a concept that tell why services are slow.
9. RSS or Resident Set Size is the memory consumed by process when it is running on ram
9. commands : /var/log/, tail, tty, /var/log/secure, tail -f, tail -n, access_log, cut -d" ", journal -ex, cat access_log | grep server-status | wc -l, top, ps -aux, ps -o rss, %cpu pid, ps -u user -U user, lsof, lsof -u username, netstat -tnlp, netstat -unlp, netstat -nct

12/04/2020 session 6
The session was good and I learned so many new things like:
1. we created a project based on Wordpress and mysql which is a blog or article site and its deployment over docker.
2. we understand about mutli-tier architecture which is a good concept and highly used in today's real world situation.
3. in multi-tier architecture we use containers running on different os and linked them in such a way that the work as a whole new dependent containers. we used wordpress and mysql for this puprose.
4. we understand about mysql service, install it, setup it, and launch it for storing the data generated through wordpress into its data base.
5. we used wordpress for making a whole new front-end of our project and customise its look and feel according to our convenience and connected it with mysql database.
6. we use almost all the concept we have learnt in previous docker class like: we use PATting, linking(DNS) from networking, apache-php webserver, volumes to store the webpages and database, and some concept of yaml language for coding.
7. we learnt about an important concept called IAAC or Infrastructure as a Code which is nothing but making a program file which consist whole infrastructure and we can launch it using a one command in one second.
8. for managing the Infrasturcture in docker we need to use docker-compose which is generally a .yml file written in .yaml programming language and everything in this language is stored inside in key-value pair format.
9. we learn how to understand and rectify the error coming in launching the project and also understand about entrypoint in docker containers and how the work in multi-tier architecture.

10/05/2020 session 7
The session was good and I learned so many new things like:
1. how to create our own docker image and understand that we have two ways commit and scripting(keywords) called dockerfile.
2. we can't use docker directly we need to use it with some other technologies like Kubernetes and Jenkins.
3. to use any services or program we need to install an os and we need to create an environment to use that service.
4. Dockerfile is the scripting file in which we can write our requirement s and build this file our whole environment will be ready in just some seconds.
5. Dockerfile is very flexible as it creates a container image which is almost suitable with any other container technology like Podman, Openshift, Rockett etc.
6. we have created some docker file in which we have setup a complete python interpreter environment and in another file we have created a complete apache-webserver environment.
7. we used some commands like: Dockerfile, docker build -t os:version /path, some important key words:
FROM, RUN,CMD, COPY, EXPOSE etc.
8. Docker image provide us isolation which is very important and necessary thing in todays world.
